# Description of the assignment

This project is a music visualiser. It creates images that are reactive to music. We decided to use the song "Surface Pressure" from the Disney movie Encanto. Our first visualiser, "fireworks," is reminiscent of a mandala pattern. It is made up of an inner and outer circle and has particles surrounding it. Our next visualiser, "spheres," is composed of multiple circles moving in the opposite directions. The third visualiser, "heart," is a flowing heart that bounces up and down according to the beat. The fourth visualiser, "space," depicts many multi-coloured pixels that compose somewhat of a galaxy image. Our final visualiser, "spikes," is composed of lines with circles at their ends. This resembles a spark.

# Instructions

When the user presses F5, the program will run.
The menu is displayed to the user.
When the user presses space, the music begins to play.
The user can choose between the different animations by selecting numbers from between 1 to 5 on the keyboard.
When the user presses 0, the menu is displayed again.
If the user presses space while the music is playing, the music stops.

# How it works

This project uses the minim library in java to make shapes react to music. We used a switch statement to alternate between the different animations. We researched and used multiple trigonometric functions throughout our program. This helped us create more complex shapes like a heart. 

Our first visualiser is similar to a mandala pattern. This visualiser reacted to the audio by spinning and creating particles. It uses basic trignometry functions to make the outline of a sun and form the outer circle.

Our second visualiser consists of multiple circles being merged into one reactive shape. This creats the illsuion of the visual being 3D. These circles react to the audio on its x and y axis making them split apart from each other the louder the music gets.

Our third visualiser is a flowing heart that is formed constantly. This is done using trignometric functions. These functions are altered by using the audio of our song to make the heart spread apart making it have a sort of glitching or bouncing effect. This was done by making the x axis react to the audio.

Our fourth visualiser resembles a colourful pixeliesd galaxy. It consists of two for loops reaching a hundred. This is so that all the particles could be made on the screen. These particles then react to the audio by appearing on the screen and lighting up.

Our last visualiser is made up of lines with circles at the end. These lines form from the centre of the screen. This uses arrays to make individual lines for the visualiser. The length of the lines and their velocity are randomised. The array values are used in our ellipse. The whole visuliser is composed of a circle, which is not seen, as the background is black. This makes the illusion of hundreds of lines emerging when reacting to the audio.


# What we are most proud of in the assignment

We are proud of this assignment because of all the things we learned throughout it. We faced difficulty in understanding how some processing functions worked, but through trying things out, we now have a much better understanding of processing in java. At the start of the project we didn't really know how to begin or progress due to us not being familiar with java but towards the end we found ourselves appreciating the language. Java is a really fun language to experiment with and this assignment proved that. Our project heavily emphasised on trigonometry this meant we had the opportunity to experiment with different mathematical functions to achieve our finished visuals. By the end of the project we had a better understanding of how to use these mathematical functions. We are proud of making varying visuals react to the music effectively. 

# Conclusion

Overall, this was a fun, experimental and playful assignment, where we could express our creativity and explore with different functions of java. This whole assignment offered a lot of freedom. We made the best duo as our creativeness and smarts made visuals that we never knew were possible within java. It opened up our eyes to what the language could offer. By the end of our project, we craved to do more and learn more about the whole language. It seems like there is no limit when it comes to java and creativity.
